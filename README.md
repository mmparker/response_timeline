A simple knitr report for displaying timelines of SurveyMonkey responses.
Download the data of interest into the statistical software format (it should
return a .zip), dump the zip into the same directory as the 
`response_timeline.rmd` file, and fire off the `generate_report.r` script.
`response_timeline.html` should contain the result.
